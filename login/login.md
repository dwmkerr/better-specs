Login Screen
============

Overview
--------

This spec is for the login screen of the application. The overall design of
the screen is in the file 'mockup.png'.

The Controls
------------

* The 'username' box accepts alphanumeric characters.
* The limit of the 'username' box is 120 characters.
* The tooltip for the username box is 'Enter Username'.
* The password box accepts any characters and is limited to 120 characters.
* The tooltip for the password box is 'Enter password'.

Logging In - Happy Path
-----------------------

If the controls are filled in correctly as stated above, the
successful login process is:

1. The 'login' button is enabled by default.
2. User enters a username.
3. User enters a password.
4. When 'login' is pressed, the button immediately becomes disabled
   and a spinner is shown to the left of the button caption.
5. When login succeededs, the application immediately moves to the 'profile'
   page.

Logging In - First Time Validation
----------------------------------

The login form will only show validation messages AFTER a click of the login
button. Rather than confusing the user with lots of red boxes with warning messages
such as 'the password field is mandatory', we'll give them a chance to key everything
in right first. If there's anything wrong, *then* we show the validation messages.
 
Logging In - Bad Credentials
----------------------------

If the controls are filled in correctly, but the credentials
are wrong, the login process is:

1. User enters a (bad) username.
2. User enters a (bad) password.
3. The 'login' button becomes enabled.
4. When 'login' is pressed, the button immediately becomes disabled
   and a spinner is shown to the left of the button caption.
5. When login fails:
   * The spinner disappears
   * The caption becomes 'login'
   * The password box is cleared.
6. Finally, an alert above the login box is shown with the title 'Login Failed'
   and the message 'Your username or password is incorrect'.
7. If the credentials are entered incorrectly three times, the user account
   is locked out.
